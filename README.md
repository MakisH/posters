# Some of my academic posters

Hi! I am [Gerasimos Chourdakis](https://github.com/MakisH), at the time of this writing a [doctoral candidate at the Technical University of Munich](https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/en/sccs/people/gerasimos-chourdakis/).

In February 2023, I used the ideas from [Mike Morrison's Better Scientific Poster](https://osf.io/ef53g/) (start from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RwJbhkCA58&pp=ygUNYmV0dGVyIHBvc3Rlcg%3D%3D)) to make [my first BetterPoster](https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/node?id=1705539&change_language=en) about our work [preCICE](https://precice.org/), first presented at SIAM CSE23. I made the poster in a few hours in Inkscape, and many colleagues have asked me for the sources since. This repository makes these sources publicly available.

I really enjoyed the experience, and I would like to see more researchers making more user-friendly posters. I was quite proud of my first BetterPoster, so, in case you use these sources, please refer your colleagues to this repository and tell them about Mike Morisson's amazing videos.
